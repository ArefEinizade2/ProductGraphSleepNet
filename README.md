# ProductGraphSleepNet
This repository implements the proposed ProductGraphSleepNet via TensorFlow and Keras. In the case of using our codes, kindly please consider citing the following paper.

## Reproduce the results on the public Montreal Archive of Sleep Studies (MASS)-SS3 database:

Step 1: Create a new folder named "MASS SS3 raw edf". Download the raw .edf files ("* Base.edf" and "* PSG.edf") of the MASS-SS3 database from the following link and put them in the "MASS SS3 raw edf" folder.

Step 2: Run `MASS_SS3_process.py` to generate the feature extracted file (i.e., "MASS_SS3_DE_16folds.npz").

Step 3: Run `MASS_SS3_Train_Test.py` to reproduce the classification results and generate the learned temporal (i.e., "MASS_SS3_LearnedGraphsTempral.npy") and spatial (i.e., "MASS_SS3_LearnedGraphsSpatial.npy") graphs.

## Reproduce the results on the public SleepEDF database:

Step 1: Create a new folder named "SleepEDF20 raw mat". Download the raw .edf files, convert them (PSG signals and their labels) to .mat files ("* -PSG.mat" with two keys "record" and "Labels") of the SleepEDF database from the following link and put them in the "SleepEDF20 raw mat" folder.

Step 2: Run `SleepEDF20_process.py` to generate the feature extracted file (i.e., "SleepEDF20_DE_20Folds.npz").

Step 3: Run `SleepEDF20_Train_Test.py` to reproduce the classification results.

## Descriptions of the provided files:

In the following, brief descriptions of all provided files are given:
- `ProductGraphSleepNet.py`: implements the proposed ProductGraphSleepNet described in the paper.
- `DE_PSD.py`: a function to calculate the Differential Entropy (DE) and Power Spectral Density (PSD) features 
- `graph_attention_layer.py`: a custom layer implementing the Graph-wise Attention (GwAT) module described in the paper
- `MASS_SS3.config` and `SleepEDF20.config`: config files to set hyperparameters and training parameters. Note that if "use_pretrained" is set to "True", the program only generates the results from pre-trained models. If "use_pretrained" is set to "False", the program trains the models entirely on the feature-extracted files.
- `MASS_SS3_process.py` and `SleepEDF20_process.py`: extracting and saving DE features from raw MASS-SS3 or SleepEDF databases.
- `MASS_SS3_DataGenerator.py` and `SleepEDF20_DataGenerator.py`: splitting the data into Cross-Subject Cross-Validation sections.
- `MASS_SS3_Utils.py` and `SleepEDF20_Utils.py`: helpful functions to visualize the results
- `MASS_SS3_Train_Test.py` and `SleepEDF20_Train_Test.py`: reproduce the results and generate the learned spatial and temporal graphs.
- `ChanLocs_and_ChanNames.mat`: locations of the EEG electrodes for visualizing the spatial graphs
- `Plot_learned_Spatial_Temporal_Graphs.m`: a MATLAB file to plot the learned graphs
