# ProductGraphSleepNet
Firstly, we would like to note that due to the larger size of the raw or feature extracted files of the MASS-SS3 and SleepEDF datasets and also the pertained models than 100 MB, unfortunately, we were not able to upload our data along with the codes. Although, if it is possible for us to send the feature extracted data to you in an alternating way, please let us know. However, in the case of acceptance of our paper, we will publish the feature extracted files and the pertained models along with the reproducible codes on Github. We hope the provided instructions are clear.

Note that some parts of the codes in the current repositary are stringly inspired by the following repositaries. Therefore, in the case of using our codes, kindly please consider siting them, too.

## Reproduce the results on the MASS-SS3 database:

Step 1: After cloning the provided .zip file, download the raw .edf files ("* Base.edf" and "* PSG.edf") of the MASS-SS3 database from the following link and put them in the "MASS SS3 raw edf" folder:

http://ceams-carsm.ca/en/mass/

Step 2: run `MASS_SS3_process.py` to generate the feature extracted file (i.e., "MASS_SS3_DE_16folds.npz").

Step 3: run "MASS_SS3_Train_Test.py" to reproduce the classification results and generate the learned temporal (i.e., "MASS_SS3_LearnedGraphsTempral.npy") and spatial (i.e., "MASS_SS3_LearnedGraphsSpatial.npy") graphs.

## Reproduce the results on the SleepEDF database:

Step 1: After cloning the provided .zip file, download the raw .edf files, convert them (PSG signals and their labels) to .mat files ("* -PSG.mat" with two keys "record" and "Labels") of the SleepEDF database from the following link and put them in the "SleepEDF20 raw mat" folder:
https://www.physionet.org/content/sleep-edfx/1.0.0/

Step 2: run "SleepEDF20_process.py" to generate the feature extracted file (i.e., "SleepEDF20_DE_20Folds.npz").

Step 3: run "SleepEDF20_Train_Test.py" to reproduce the classification results.

In the following, brief descriptions of all provided files are given:
- `ProductGraphSleepNet.py`: implements the proposed ProductGraphSleepNet described in the paper.
- `DE_PSD.py`: a function to calculate the Differential Entropy (DE) and Power Spectral Density (PSD) features 
- `graph_attention_layer.py`: a custom layer implementing the Graph-wise Attention (GwAT) module described in the paper
- `MASS_SS3.config` and `SleepEDF20.config`: config files to set hyperparameters and training parameters. Note that if "use_pretrained" is set to "True", the program only generates the results from pre-trained models. If "use_pretrained" is set to "False", the program trains the models entirely on the feature extracted files.
- `MASS_SS3_process.py` and `SleepEDF20_process.py`: extracting and saving DE features from raw MASS-SS3 or SleepEDF databases.
- `MASS_SS3_DataGenerator.py` and `SleepEDF20_DataGenerator.py`: splitting the data into Cross-Subject Cross-Validation sections.
- `MASS_SS3_Utils.py` and `SleepEDF20_Utils.py`: helpful functions to visualize the results
- `MASS_SS3_Train_Test.py` and `SleepEDF20_Train_Test.py`: reproduce the results and generate the learned spatial and temporal graphs.
- `ChanLocs_and_ChanNames.mat`: locations of the EEG electrodes for visualizing the spatial graphs
- `Plot_learned_Spatial_Temporal_Graphs.m`: a MATLAB file to plot the learned graphs
